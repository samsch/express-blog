## HTTPS config
# For development, you can generate a self-signed cert using:
# `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365`.
# For production, you can use the free https://letsencrypt.org/ service to obtain a cert and key file,
# or get them from other services.
# If you don't define securePort, the app will be served over http only, but you could also provide
# tls/https by using a proxy server. This is actually recommended by some.
